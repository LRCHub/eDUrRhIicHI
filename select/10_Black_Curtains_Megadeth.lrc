[00:22.02] Hey, look around you, everything's helter-skelter
[00:27.48] Listen up, I warn you, run for cover, run
[00:33.65] Bang, it happened; time's up, Armageddon
[00:38.12] Fire, meltdown, the sky is crumbling in
[00:57.62] 
[00:47.31] Black curtains, never-ending
[00:53.02] Black curtains
[01:00.02] 
[00:54.49] Escape, you're joking, can't find no place to run
[00:59.37] Hair is burning, my flesh is bubbling up
[01:05.15] Blood is boiling, taste copper on my tongue
[01:10.64] Fate is coming, welcome it with a smile
[01:30.14] 
[01:19.71] Black curtains, never-ending
[01:25.15] Black curtains fall
[01:30.80] Black curtains, never-ending
[01:36.18] Black curtains
[01:43.18] 
[01:38.26] "Something's under my skin
[01:42.08] Something's very strange, playing with my mind, tempting me to do you in"
[02:18.58] 
[01:48.24] Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest
[01:53.18] Held for ransom in a spider's web
[01:58.42] Suffocating, no one hears my calls
[02:03.85] Never-ending, 'til the black curtain falls
[02:24.85] 
[02:54.26] Snakes surround me, offering their death kiss to me
[02:57.91] Down, I'm drowning; how long? I hold my breath
[03:03.65] Dogs are chasing, my legs are paralysed
[03:08.65] Pray, don't find me, my life is fading fast
[03:30.15] 
[03:18.13] Black curtains, never-ending
[03:23.38] Black curtains fall
[03:28.74] Black curtains, never-ending
[03:34.19] Black curtains
