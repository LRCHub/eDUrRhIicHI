When you're lonely
What do you think of
In the late hours of night
Tell me why

Seven am haven't slept yet
Tears in my eyes plead
Oh please help me

Waiting for lavender
An open door
To close my eyes
The curtain's moon
It shines too soon
Just let it fade into midnight

When you're lonely
What do you think of
In the late hours of night

Waiting for lavender
An open door
To close my eyes
The curtain's moon
It shines too soon
Just let it fade into midnight
